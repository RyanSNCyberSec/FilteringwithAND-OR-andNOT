<h1>Filtering with AND, OR, and NOT as well as some completed Joins in SQL </h1>

 

<h2>Description</h2>
In this scenario, I used the AND, OR, and NOT operators in SQL to filter for information. This was done to get specific information about employees, their machines, and the departments theyâ€™re in. Additionally, I use INNER JOIN and RIGHT JOIN to retrieve information from two different tables, from separate machines, employees, and login attempts tables. This was done to investigate a recent security incident that compromised some machines.
